# Node HTTP Server

This is a primitive example of a Node server with a single endpoint that supports fetching and creating some dummy data.

Run 
```
npm install
```
to install dependencies.

Then run tests with
```
npm test
```
to observe how the server responds to different types of valid and invalid requests.
